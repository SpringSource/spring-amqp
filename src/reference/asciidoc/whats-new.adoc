==== Changes in 2.2 Since 2.1

This section describes the changes between version 2.1 and version 2.2.

===== @RabbitListener Changes

You can now configure an `executor` on each listener, overriding the factory configuration, to more easily identify threads associated with the listener.
See <<async-annotation-driven-enable>> for more information.

When using <<receiving-batch,batching>>, `@RabbitListener` methods can now receive a complete batch of messages in one call instead of getting them one at at time.

===== AMQP Logging Appenders Changes

The Log4J and Logback `AmqpAppender` s now support a `verifyHostname` SSL option.
See <<logging>> for more information.

===== MessageListenerAdapter Changes

`MessageListenerAdapter` provides now a new method to build an array of arguments to be passed into target listener
and an old one is deprecated.
See <<message-listener-adapter>> for more information.
