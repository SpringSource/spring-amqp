==== Changes in 1.7 Since 1.6

===== Log4j2 upgrade

The minimum Log4j2 version is `2.7` right now.
The framework isn't compatible with previous version any more.
See <<logging>> for more information.

===== Spring Retry upgrade

The minimum Spring Retry version is `1.2`.
The framework isn't compatible with previous version if `null` keys are expected for stateful retry logic.
The `MissingMessageIdAdvice` has been deprecated since Spring Retry doesn't support `null` keys in the `RetryContextCache`.
Now such messages are treated ans non-retryable and can be rejected and not requeued via `AbstractMessageListenerContainer.statefulRetryFatalWithNullMessageId` property.

The minimum Jackson version is `2.8`.
The framework isn't compatible with previous version any more.
